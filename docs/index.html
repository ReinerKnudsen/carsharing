		<p>I will pick up developing my car sharing app with React now.</p>
		<p>
			The first version of this app runs on Microsoft Power Apps, and we use it a lot. But one always has to install the
			Power Apps app on the mobile device, which is really bothersome. I want to be more independent.
		</p>
		<h2>Data model</h2>
		<p>
			First, I drafted the data model based on what we already have in Power Apps. Right now there will only be one car,
			though, but many people will share multiple cars in the future.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is the data structure in its first draft.
